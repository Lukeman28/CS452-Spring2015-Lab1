To create this program I set up multiple buffers that stored the three different shapes. 
Then had one shape load ons tartup and a onclick command that would 
execute a function that would upload a different shape buffer and redraw it along with
incrementing a counter that would reset back to oen once it reached 4 allowing for the loop effect
